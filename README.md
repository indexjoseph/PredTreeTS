Author: **Joseph Oladeji**

# Description

**Predicate Tree** is a program that will allow for the user to enter in a letter
and will provide a list of results then display it to the user. Each time the 
user enters the another character it will display another list of results each
time until the user finds the word their searching for or the word could not
be found. The program will keep track of successfully searched words and allow
for the user to clear the searcy history as well. It alows allows thhe user to
 remove characters from their query.

## Usage

node-ts Driver.js `<filename>`

node-ts Driver.js 

If no file is passed then by default the file within the input directory will be
used as the dictionary words to initialize the Predicate Tree. However, if the
user decides they want to user their own dictionary they must pass the location
of the text tile where their dictionary resides.
